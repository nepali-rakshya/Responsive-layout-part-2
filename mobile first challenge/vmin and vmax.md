# 1. As we know that, 1vh and 1vw means 1% of height and 1% of width of the browser window respectively.

# 2. vmin and vmax performs similar functions but with some different concepts.

# VMIN :

# In case of vmin it checks whether the sides of the browser window that is the height or width is minimum and acts accordingly. if 1vmin is being given then whichever side whether be it width or height is smaller it occupies 1vw or 1vh for it.

# VMAX:

# Now vmax is opposite to the vmin. if 1vmax is given then it checks which side is larger either width or height then it goes along with the larger side.
